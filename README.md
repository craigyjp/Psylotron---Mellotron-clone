# Psylotron---Mellotron-clone
Arduino and wav trigger based Mellotron clone

A clone of the classic Mellotron keyboard

Arduino Nano/Uno based Mellotron sample playback device using a robertsonics wav trigger, although I'm sure it will also work on the later Tsunami wav trigger device for more polyphony and ability to play mono and stereo samples.

Components used:-

Arduino Uni or Nano
Suitable opto coupler for MIDI input (4n35 in this case)
Adafruit (Robertsonics) wav trigger sample playback board.
i2c 1602 LCD display or OLED with an i2c interface attached.
Two toggle switches
4 push buttons (led surrounds optional)
3 10k lin rotary pots 

Optional for low pass filter or tone control.

Suitable stereo or mono depending on your tastes tone control circuit for high/low boost or low pass filter.
